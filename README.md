# destiny-rollbot

A reddit bot that lists all possible perks a gun can roll in Destiny 2.  It looks for content inside curly braces {} and searches the Destiny API for a valid match.  It calls the Destiny API to create a list of all possible perks for each perk column.  It formats the results as a reddit table and replies to the comment with this table.
